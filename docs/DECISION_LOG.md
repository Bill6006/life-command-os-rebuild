# Decision log

Decisions that shape the rebuild and the reason behind each one. Entries are
append-only. When a decision is reversed, add a new entry that supersedes the
old one rather than editing history.

Authority order (canonical plan section 1): explicit current owner decisions →
this canonical plan → owner-approved amendments → this log → verified
implementation in this repository.

## D-001 — The rebuild lives in a brand-new repository

**Phase:** 0 · **Status:** Active

`Bill6006/life-command-os-rebuild` is the rebuild. `Bill6006/life-command-os` is
legacy/reference only and must never be modified, reinitialized, force-pushed,
repointed or overwritten.

**Why:** Canonical plan sections 0 and 45. A new foundation cannot be built
inside a tree whose history and remotes belong to the architecture being
replaced.

**Safety gate result:** The gate ran before anything was created. The shell's
starting directory turned out to be the legacy working tree, which is an
explicit stop condition, so the developer stopped and the owner chose a separate
location. `life-command-os-rebuild` did not exist remotely, so no name had to be
invented. The legacy repository was fingerprinted (`HEAD 45091d0`, 32 unpushed
local commits, 1 untracked file) so it can be proven unchanged at the gate.

## D-002 — The repository is public

**Phase:** 0 · **Status:** Active

**Why:** GitHub Pages on a private repository requires a paid plan. The stable
phone Preview URL is a hard development requirement (section 33), so a free,
reliable Pages deployment matters more than repository secrecy — particularly
because section 39 already keeps all real owner data out of the repository.
Owner-approved before creation.

**Consequence:** Fixtures are synthetic only. Real backups, exports and owner
history must never be committed. `.gitignore` blocks the obvious shapes, and a
privacy scan runs at each phase gate.

---

## D-003 — Preview and production are two paths on one `gh-pages` branch

**Phase:** 0 · **Status:** Active

- Preview: `https://bill6006.github.io/life-command-os-rebuild/preview/`
- Production: `https://bill6006.github.io/life-command-os-rebuild/`

The preview workflow replaces only the `preview/` subtree. The production
workflow is `workflow_dispatch` only and writes only the root, never `preview/`.

**Why:** Section 33 requires one stable bookmarkable Preview URL _and_ that
production is not updated merely because preview changes. GitHub Pages'
Actions-artifact mode was rejected: each deployment replaces the entire site, so
a single artifact would have to contain both, meaning every preview deploy would
also republish production.

**Rejected alternatives:** Cloudflare Pages or Netlify (adds an external account
and an auth dependency for no gain); a second repository for preview (more
moving parts, and section 45 forbids inventing extra repositories).

---

## D-004 — Preview deploys on every push to `main`

**Phase:** 0 · **Status:** Active

**Why:** It keeps the deployed Preview SHA equal to `main` HEAD at all times,
which makes the section 58 requirement — that the deployed Preview SHA matches
the verified checkpoint SHA — true by construction rather than by inspection.
The deploy job depends on the verification job, so a red gate never reaches the
phone.

---

## D-005 — Hash routing

**Phase:** 0 · **Status:** Active, revisitable

**Why:** The site is served from a sub-path on GitHub Pages with no server-side
rewrite available. Hash routes are deep-linkable, back-button correct and cannot
404 on a phone bookmark. The alternative — a `404.html` SPA fallback — returns a
real 404 status and is easy to get subtly wrong.

**Revisit if:** a rewrite-capable host is ever adopted.

---

## D-006 — No service worker in this phase

**Phase:** 0 · **Status:** Active until Phase 10

No worker is registered, and any worker previously registered at this scope is
unregistered on load. Asset filenames are content-hashed, so only `index.html`
can be served stale; the running app re-reads `build-info.json` with `no-store`
on load and whenever the tab becomes visible, and offers an explicit reload when
the deployed SHA differs.

**Why:** Section 33 — "The owner should never have to wonder whether the phone
is showing stale code." Offline behaviour is Phase 10 work and must not be
bought at the cost of preview ambiguity now. A failed check is never reported as
staleness, so an offline phone is not told its build is old.

---

## D-007 — Build identity is compiled in and also published as a file

**Phase:** 0 · **Status:** Active

The commit SHA, branch, target and build time are injected at build time and
emitted to `build-info.json` beside `index.html`.

**Why:** Section 33 requires proving that the deployed Preview SHA matches the
verified checkpoint SHA at every handoff. A plain HTTP request to
`build-info.json` answers that without opening the app, and the same values
drive the in-app About/QA panel and the stale-build check.

---

## D-008 — Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript, Vitest, Playwright

**Phase:** 0 · **Status:** Active

Strict TypeScript, including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and
`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

**Why:** Section 45 asks for "Vite/TypeScript/React or equivalent modern static
frontend". Strict settings are cheap now and materially harder to adopt once the
canonical record layer exists. Playwright covers 360px, 430px and 1280px;
physical-phone validation stays mandatory regardless (section 37).

---

## D-009 — Initial visual direction: illuminated dark, single ember accent

**Phase:** 0 · **Status:** Active, deliberately unlocked

Deep blue-charcoal ground (never black), surfaces that climb toward the light,
one warm ember accent reserved for the current decision, a violet used only
inside gradients for depth, and body text at or above 6:1 contrast.

**Why:** Section 24 asks for dark-first, alive, dimensional and grounded while
explicitly rejecting the cave, the submarine console, neon card borders and
gamer RGB. Depth comes from light and shadow rather than outlines, which is what
separates this from a control panel.

**Not locked:** Section 69 keeps the exact palette, radii and animation system
open until the interface has been judged on a real phone.

---

## D-010 — Phase 0 screens state honestly that nothing is built

**Phase:** 0 · **Status:** Active

Now, Life, Timeline and Insights render real design but say plainly that there
is no engine, no record store and no learning yet.

**Why:** Section 36 — a fallback must not look like a confident empty-state
answer. Showing a plausible-looking recommendation before the engine exists
would be exactly the "large UI in front of a weak brain" failure this rebuild
exists to correct.
