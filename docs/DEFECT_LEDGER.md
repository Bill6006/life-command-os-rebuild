# Defect ledger

Verified defects and their resolution. Canonical plan section 42 governs the
process:

1. reproduce;
2. identify the whole defect **class**, not only the reported line;
3. write a focused regression;
4. prove the regression fails when the defect is reintroduced;
5. fix the root cause;
6. rerun focused coverage;
7. rerun the full relevant gate.

A defect is not closed until a regression exists that would have caught it, and
until its siblings in the same failure class have been checked.

## Entry format

```
### DEF-000n — <short title>

- Status:        Open | Fixed | Won't fix
- Severity:      Blocker | Major | Minor
- Found in:      <phase> / <SHA>
- Found by:      <automated gate | owner phone test | independent adversarial pass>
- Class:         <the whole family of failures this belongs to>
- Reproduction:  <exact steps or failing scenario>
- Root cause:    <what was actually wrong, not the symptom>
- Regression:    <test file and name that fails when the defect is reintroduced>
- Siblings:      <other places sharing the class, and their status>

### DEF-0001 — recommendation templates reached for a pronoun

- Status: Fixed
- Severity: Major — this is the defect scenario G-001 exists to prevent
- Found in: Phase 1 / pre-`b637ab3`
- Found by: the automated class sweep in `tests/synthetic/g001-no-orphan-pronoun.test.ts`,
  on its first run
- Class: **any sentence template that can render a pronoun where the subject is
  known.** Not "three bad strings" — a catalogue that grows one verb at a time,
  where each new entry is an opportunity to reintroduce the same failure.
- Reproduction: render `review-weak-topic`, `recover`, or the `deficit` reason
  for any subject. Sentences came out as "Go back over subnetting, the part
  **that** keeps slipping", "…leave you better **this** morning", "subnetting is
  the **thing** running short".
- Root cause: the templates were written by hand with no rule applied to them.
  The subject was present in every case, so the defect was invisible to a
  spot-check of one sentence — which is exactly how it would have reached a
  phone.
- Regression: `tests/synthetic/g001-no-orphan-pronoun.test.ts` — "covers every
  verb in the catalogue", "covers every reason the catalogue can give", and
  "also renders cleanly with no duration and no goal". The sweep walks
  `ACTION_VERBS` and `WHY_NOW_TRIGGERS` rather than a list of known-bad cases,
  so a fourteenth verb is checked the moment it exists.
- Siblings: checked and clean — all fourteen verbs, both the with-duration and
  without-duration forms, all eight reasons, and every follow-up question.
- Note on the fix: the copy changed, not the rule. Relaxing the check to allow
  a relative pronoun would have been defensible for each individual sentence and
  would have left a loophole the next template gets written through.
- Fixed in: `b637ab3`
